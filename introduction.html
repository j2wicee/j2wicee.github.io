      <p>
        I am a junior at UNC Charlotte studying Computer Science with a focus in
        Software Engineering.
        <br />
        I enjoy developing web applications, both frontend and backend, as well
        as mobile apps.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Personal Background: </strong> I am currently 21 years old,
          from Pinehurst, NC. I enjoy playing video games, cooking, and playing
          basketball at UREC.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Professional Background: </strong> I currently work a retail
          job, but during the summers I do freelance development work with my
          friend.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Academic Background: </strong> I am currently a junior here at
          UNCC studying computer science with a concentration in Software
          Engineering.<br />
          I transferred here from NC State University this fall, so this is only
          my second semester here, and still trying to get accustomed to
          everything Charlotte has to offer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> I have experience in this
          subject, but it is all self-taught and learned through building
          real-world projects. <br />I took this course to gain a deeper
          understanding of concepts I already knew.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Primary Work Computer:</strong> I split a lot of my work based
          on my location. If I am home, then I will do my work on the Windows PC
          that I built, and if I am in class, I have a MacBook Air.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Secondary Work Computer:</strong> The backup will be the
          computer that I am not currently working with. I have all of my files
          shared between the two.
        </li>

          <strong>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</strong>

              >Wanted to get a more formal learning experience for frontend
              development.

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>ITSC 2181 - Introduction to Computer Systems: </strong>I
              feel like it could be interesting, and it gives me another
              language to add to my resume.
            </li>

              <strong
